# Task: 
# Create a parent class Vehicle with:

# An attribute brand.

# A method describe() that returns: "This is a vehicle."

# Create a child class Car that inherits from Vehicle and:

# Adds an attribute model.

# Overrides the describe() method to return: "This is a [brand] [model]."

# Test it:
# Create an object of Car and call its describe()Â method.
